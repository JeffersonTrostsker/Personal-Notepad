IMPORTANT NOTE FROM MOCKITO:

You included the 'mockito-android' dependency in a non-Android environment.
The Android mock maker was disabled. You should only include the latter in your 'androidTestCompile' configuration
If disabling was a mistake, you can set the 'org.mockito.mock.android' property to 'true' to override this detection.

Visit https://javadoc.io/page/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/Mockito.html#0.1 for more information
